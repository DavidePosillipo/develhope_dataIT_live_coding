"""EX 1
In this exercise, youâ€™ll define a class, Scoop, that represents a single scoop of ice cream.
Each scoop should have a single attribute, flavor, a string that you can initialize when you 
create the instance of Scoop. Once your class is created, write a function (create_scoops) that 
creates three instances of the Scoop class, each of which has a different flavor. 
Put these three instances into a list called scoops. Finally, iterate over your scoops list, 
printing the flavor.
